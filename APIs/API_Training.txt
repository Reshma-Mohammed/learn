API - Application programming Interface - Any application which is contacted uing program from an interface.
Soap and Rest Apis
Webhooks
Webservices


First the request is authenticated and then authorize 
Communications within two small features/functions are called microservices.

All the Webservices are APIs but not sll the APIs are Webservices. Internet is used to request a response called a webservices. However, There can be requests internally from servers to request info, which do not need internet or webservices. 

Microservices are modules within a program. 
example Amazon - Entire site is a program, a set of services - catalogues, customer care, orders, content writers of the product, each of these is a microservice.

Open APIs different from Rest APIs

Example: whatsapp - Application; chat or call - Prgoram, Chat window - interface.

Application - server
Program - module on that application
Interface - the location/place where we interact the application

Simple API(straight forward api/1 level - request-response) and Complex APIs (one api redirecting to another api)

The standards of using API are Json, Java

Types of APIs:
1. Soap - simple object access protocol - are obselete now
Soaps require xml
message format defined through WSDL (web services description language file.

2. Webhooks - example alerts 

3. Rest Apis
Representational state transafer
Uses HTTP as a transport protocol
Architectural Styles
RESTfulAPIs
Message format is JSON, Javascript Object Notation 

OpenAPI Specifications
Swagger - Tony - nows its OpenAPI Specification  

standard specification of the APIs easy to consume or collabrate with other language

JSON - JavaScript Object Notation

Data Structures 
 - Strings - enclosed in double quotes "5" - will be a text
 - Numbers - integers 0-infinity
 - Boolean - True/False

Arrays: 
 - Lists - list of elements (numbers, colors always in [] square brackets
 [1, 4, 789, 97]
 ["rose", "daisy", "jasmine"]
 
Objects: flower brackets
 - JSON's dictionaries
 - Key Value Pairs
   example, {"abhi" = 1, ...."yuva" = 26} in this, key has a value

Nesting: If can define more key values and other elements by nesting it. 
{"abhi" = 1,"profession" = "job" ...."yuva" = 26}

JASON

{
"product":
	{
	"title": "Samsung",
	"series": "S series",
	"model": ["s7", "S9", "S10"]
	}	
}

check in json formatter on google or change language to json (check course on udemy)
